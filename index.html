<h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> For the first 16 years of my life i lived in Boston, Massachusettts. Other than snowboarding, not very interesting. Which is why when my dad asked if I wanted to pack my things and move to somewhere I would sweat 24/7, 365 days a year; I didnt hesitate to say yes. In hindsight, maybe somewhere not as hot; but thigns worked out nicely so im not complaining.I moved to Florida my junior year in High School. It was a big difference going from a school with about 1000 kids, to almost 1000 kids in my class. Luckily for me I have always been a people person, always trying to keep positivity and fun in my life, so making friends and having a good time was easy for me.</p>
    
    <p>Currently I am enrolled at FGCU as a software engineer. I have always been into technology, mostly due to having the rest of my family be into it. The reason im a software engineer is because I want to go into the automotive industry through technology. Even earlier than being into technology, I was into cars. I have always loved everything about cars, from the sound, the design, to the building and modification process. I hope to get into concept design, or the building process of cars. </p>
